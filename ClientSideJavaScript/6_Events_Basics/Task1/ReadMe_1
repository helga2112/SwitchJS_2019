Implement a custom context menu for Tux, the penguin (imagine the penguin picture on the page).        
This is the HTML for a menu which exists, but is currently hidden:

<div id=""menu"">
  <div id=""option1"">Photograph</div>
  <div id=""option2"">Rub belly</div>
  <div id=""option3"">Feed a fish</div>
</div>

Write some JavaScript code below that does as many of the following as you can:

1. Add a click event handler to the penguin (his id is ""tux"") that makes the menu visible (style.display = 'block').
2. Move the menu (e.g. style.left = '123px' and style.top = '123px') to the mouse's location. Use the event's pageX and pageY properties.
3. Instead of using click, use contextmenu to detect the right mouse button.
4. Supress the browser's own context menu.
5. Add a click handler to the whole page (document.body) that hides the menu (style.display = 'none').
6. Add event handlers to each option that does something."
