"Exercise: Roomie Shopping List
*Has to be done with a regular Gmail account, not Google Apps

    Create a new Google spreadsheet.
    Add columns for “item”, “quantity”, and “requestor”.
    Add 5 rows (whatever your fridge is missing!).
    Publish the spreadsheet (via File->Publish as webpage).
    Use the JSONP technique to bring the published feed into your page as JSON.
    The URL should be of this form:
    https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/o03712292828507838454.2635427448373779250/od6/public
    /basic?alt=json-in-script&callback=listTasks

    The URL is like:

http://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/{SPREADSHEET_KEY}/{WORKSHEET_ID}/
public/basic?alt=json-in-script&callback={callbackName}

The spreadsheet key is usually in the URL, the worksheet ID is always od6
for the first worksheet, and callback name is whatever your function is called.

    Create a <ul> with each shopping item as an <li>.
    Bonus: Use the Google Image Search API to find an image for each item."
